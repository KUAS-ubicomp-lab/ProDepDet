# <B> ProDepDet </B>
ProDepDet is a framework which is specifically designed to use the knowledge of a pre-trained language model (PLM) in structure and semantic modelling in multi-party conversations to perform depression detection which is an unseen out-of-domain task. To our knowledge, this study is the first attempt to adapt the acquired knowledge of a PLM for out-of-domain task modelling using prompt tuning (PT)-based cross-task transferability.

# The Approach

![Prompt Transferability across Different Tasks drawio](https://github.com/KUAS-ubicomp-lab/ProDepDet/assets/4902204/7a032da5-5167-4d39-b00b-44e4059531f3)

The main contributions are: 
- A novel method is proposed for enhancing out-of-domain task transferability of PT. 
- A soft verbalizer is introduced along with a soft PT template for PT transferring for the first time. 
- Multiple downstream tasks are used to evaluate the generalization and interpretability of the novel methods.
