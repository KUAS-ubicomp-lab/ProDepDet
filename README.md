# <B> ProDepDet </B>
ProDepDet is a framework which is specifically designed to use the knowledge of a pre-trained language model (PLM) in structure and semantic modelling in multi-party conversations to perform depression detection which is an unseen out-of-domain task. To our knowledge, this study is the first attempt to adapt the acquired knowledge of a PLM for out-of-domain task modelling using PT-based cross-task transferability. 

# The Approach



The main contributions are: (1) A novel method is proposed for enhancing out-of-domain task transferability of PT. (2) A soft verbalizer is introduced along with a soft PT template for PT transferring for the first time. (3) Multiple downstream tasks are used to evaluate the generalization and interpretability of the novel methods.
